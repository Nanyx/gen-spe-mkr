# Gen Spe Mkr
Stands for Genesys Specialization Maker. Due to the community demand to bring back the talents tree from Star Wars FFG to Genesys, FFG as created a PDF of it. I was building my own module for Genesys and find it more usefull to have this on an web app and share it with the community. I'm sure I'm not the only one who this little web page will be usefull ;)

## Be advise
This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). I didn't have finished to implement everything I wanted into it.

### Road Map
- Import / export (Workbook style so you can tidy up your work)
- Power tree (like those in Force and Destiny)
- Pinacle (extended part of a specialization sheet)

## Note
A really big thanks to Fantasy Flight Game to make such wonderfull content.
